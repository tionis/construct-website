			We both brought experience in Call of Cthulhu, he some more of D20 Systems and myself of Chronicles of Darkness and Shadowrun to the Table. We sat together and decided to solve the Problem in our own way, the IT way.<br>
			We sat together and decided we wanted a System that has following properties:
			<ul>
			  <li>Easy to learn. play and customize.</li>
			  <li>Contains skill progression that follows the gauss distribution.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>After giving the whole thing some thought, we decided on a D10 based System (optionally with D6s) with a very strong modularity. This enabled us to use concepts from the IT World to enable Users to build their own System with bundles. While this rule system will not be published for copyright reasons, the system that automatically manages rule sets will be published. To learn more about how this work, read the documentation.</p>
